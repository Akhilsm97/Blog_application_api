Project Overview
This DRF project aims to provide a RESTful API for managing data in a Django application. The API supports common operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources. It is designed to be scalable and easy to extend.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python (3.x)
Django (>= 3.2)
Django Rest Framework (>= 3.12)
You can install these prerequisites using:

bash
Copy code
pip install Django==3.2
pip install djangorestframework==3.12
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
Set up the virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Mac
# For Windows
# venv\Scripts\activate
Install the project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Migrate the database:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Now, you should be able to view the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Configuration
Configure any necessary settings by updating the settings.py file. Modify the database configurations, static file settings, and other environment-specific variables as needed.

Database Setup
The project uses Django's built-in database systems. Make sure you have configured the correct database settings in the settings.py. By default, it uses SQLite. To switch to other database systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server), modify the DATABASES configuration.

API Endpoints
The DRF project exposes the following API endpoints:

GET /api/<model>/: Retrieve a list of all <model> instances.
GET /api/<model>/<id>/: Retrieve details of a specific <model> instance by ID.
POST /api/<model>/: Create a new <model> instance.
PUT /api/<model>/<id>/: Update an existing <model> instance.
DELETE /api/<model>/<id>/: Delete a <model> instance.
Authentication
The project uses token-based authentication with Django Rest Framework’s TokenAuthentication class. To generate a token, make a POST request to the /auth/token/ endpoint with your credentials. You will receive a token that can be used for subsequent requests.

Testing
The project includes unit tests to verify API functionality. You can run tests using:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py test
